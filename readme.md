## For Github Actions

When we were building EaF, we realized that most of its users will want to use it for continous integration and development. That is why we are one of the first NPM packages that is designed not to be downloaded, you can just run EaF with the `npx` command- its that easy. You don't need any special command parameters or files that stink up your root directory- our impact is as minimal as possible. If you really want to customize EaF, just add what you want to the `package.json` file.

```yml
name: Lint, Prettify, Test, and Score Code

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run the EAF Linter
        run: npx eaf-linter

      - name: Commit Changes
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7
        messages: ðŸ¦† Code Fixed with EaF-Lint!
```
